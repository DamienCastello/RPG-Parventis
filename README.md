# Building a Dungeon Crawler Game - Part 3

In this episode we will take everything we have learned in the past 12 episodes at ReactU and apply them to a 2d role-playing game much in the likes of the Final Fantasy I-III!

We will use a player spritemap to animate our walk and add some more tile types to our map and adjust some styling to make it all look a bit nicer. We will add some more redux state to store the values needed for the spritemap animation.
